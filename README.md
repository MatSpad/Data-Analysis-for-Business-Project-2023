# Data Analysis for Business Projects
## Midterm
### Part I: Classification
The dataset contains information about bank customers. The script is udeful to build multiple models to predict whether a customer will close his credit card account, in that case the bank may try to propose more convenient services and prevent the client from leaving the bank.

### Part II: Clustering
The dataset contains information about annual customersâ€™ purchases from a Portuguese wholesale retailer. The script is useful to find homogeneous groups of customers with similar purchasing behaviours based on quantitative variables only.

## Final
The dataset contains information about automobiles: each of the 205 observations represents a different car model, with details about its features and price.

The script is useful to:
- prepare the dataset for subsequent analysis by cleaning it and encoding categorical values;
- conduct an explanatory data analysis to understand variables and their correlations;
- build and compare multiple predictive models for cars' prices based on their characteristics;
- apply, visualize and compare many clusterizations of car types based on selected covariates.
